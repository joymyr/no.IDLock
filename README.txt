ID Lock is the market's most modern and reliable digital door lock for retrofitting in the Scandinavian market.
Forget the key for good and lock yourself and your family in the house as suits you best.

Notes:
• Version 2.1.0 added support for adding PIN codes. Go to the app settings to add PIN codes, then go to the lock settings -> Maintenance and press "Synchronize PIN codes" to send them to the lock.
• Some users have issues adding the lock correctly. In this case you can try the following steps:
    ◦ Keep the Homey hub within 1 meter from the lock
    ◦ Remove all the batteries, remove the Z-Wave module and wait one minute
    ◦ Connect the Z-Wave module again and insert the batteries
    ◦ Make sure you start the inclusion from the IDLock app, and not the general Z-Wave inclusion
