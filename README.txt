ID Lock is the market's most modern and reliable digital door lock for retrofitting in the Scandinavian market.
Forget the key for good and lock yourself and your family in the house as suits you best.

Notes:
• Version 2.1.0 added support for adding PIN codes in the app settings. If you added your lock before this version, you will have to remove and add the lock again to be able to synchronize the PIN codes to the lock.
• Some users have issues adding the lock correctly. In this case you can try the following steps:
    ◦ Keep the Homey hub within 1 meter from the lock
    ◦ Remove all the batteries, remove the Z-Wave module and wait one minute
    ◦ Connect the Z-Wave module again and insert the batteries
    ◦ Make sure you start the inclusion from the IDLock app, and not the general Z-Wave inclusion
